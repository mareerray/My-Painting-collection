    <h1>❉Maire's Painting Collection❉</h1>
    <div id="box-1">
    <h2>These are the collection of the paintings I created after one month of learning how to paint with watercolors. 
        Although painting is so satisfying and therapeutic, making a good piece of artwork is not at all as easy as it seems. 
        However, my experience with watercolors makes me realize that 'balance' is the key to success.
        Sometimes you have to loosen your need to control and let colors and water do their magic. 
        But other times you might have to learn to control your brush strokes in order to create or emphasize your own styles.
        For this reason, painting has become my de-stress hobby as well as my creative workshop. I paint whenever I feel like having a good time.
